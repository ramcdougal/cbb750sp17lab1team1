Your group has until <b>11:25</b> to design and implement a MongoDB database to store the morphology data, to populate the database, and to write functions to display the results of certain queries. Collaborate with your team using GitHub. At the end of class, your team will give a 10 minute presentation discussing the problem, your solution, and any interesting challenges you encountered.<br/><br/>\n",
